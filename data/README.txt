"SCDB_2017_01_justiceCentered_LegalProvision.csv" is the original SCDB
justice-centered database

"SCDB_M_justiceCentered.csv" is the justice-centered database with Sorenson's
additions.

"SCDB_M_caseCentered.csv" is the case-centered database with Sorenson's additions

"chiefjustices.csv" is a short file with the start- and end- dates of chief
justices. While this information could have been gathered from the data,
it is also easily available on wikipedia, and it was easier to simply include 
it in its own file rather than traverse and manipulate the data again.

More detailed explanations of the data, and what those additions entail, are on
our public page: http://www.bowdoin.edu/~acphilli/proj/scotus-data-project/public/web/in-depth.html

We have not made any additional transformations to the data.
