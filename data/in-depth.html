      <div class="heading"> <h2>Detailed Data Information</h2></div>
      <div class="content">
        <p> We are using the Justice Centered and Case Centered versions of the
          SCDB, organized by Issue/Legal Provision. The former has around 100,000
          lines of data (1 for each justice's vote in each case) and the latter
          around 10,000 lines of data (1 for each case). The justice-centered
          dataset includes all of the information in the case-centered dataset,
          in addition to information about each justice's votes. </p>
        <p>There are 54 or 63 attributes in total for the case-centered and
          justice-centered databases, respectively. In particular, we are
          interested in variables which describe the timeline of the court,
          decision and voting information, and the issue area. These are
          described below. Information about every attribute, including the
          specifics of how they are determined, can be found in the <a
            href="http://scdb.wustl.edu/_brickFiles/2017_01/SCDB_2017_01_codebook.pdf">SCDB Codebook</a>.</p>
        <p>Both databases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>term: Term (year) of the court</li>
          <li>chief: Last name of the Chief Custice of the court</li>
          <li>issueArea: Number representing which of 14 issue areas the case lies within</li>
          <li>decisionDirection: 1 if the decision in the case was conservative, 2 if liberal, or 3 if unspecifiable</li>
          <li>majVotes: the number of votes in the majority</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Justice-centered only:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>justiceName: The (abbreviated) name of each justice</li>
          <li>direction: 1 if the direction of the justice's vote was conservative, 2 if liberal, or 3 if unspecifiable</li>
          <li>majority: 2 if the justice voted with the majority, 3 if with the dissent</li>
          <li>median: 1 if the justice is the median justice, 0 if not</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, the relevant attributes in a line of data from the justice-centered database might look like this:</p>
        <div style="overflow-x:auto;">
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>justiceName</th>
              <th>term</th>
              <th>chief</th>
              <th>issueArea</th>
              <th>decisionDirection</th>
              <th>majVotes</th>
              <th>direction</th>
              <th>majority</th>
              <th>median</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <th>RBGinsburg</th>
              <th>2015</th>
              <th>Roberts</th>
              <th>3</th>
              <th>2</th>
              <th>5</th>
              <th>2</th>
              <th>2</th>
              <th>0</th>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>Or, in plain english: In 2015, under Chief Justice Roberts, the court released a liberal decision in a case about First Amendment issues. Justice Ginsburg voted with the majority (liberal). She was not the median justice at the time.</p>

      <div class="heading"> <h3>Additions to the SCDB</h3></div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Some of those are not present in the original dataset, but were
        added by Professor Sorenson. The newly-introduced variables are the
        following:</p>
        <p>In the both databases:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>term: explained above</li>
          <li>medianJJ:   The name of the median (or swing-vote) justice</li>
          <li>lib_median: 1 when the court is liberal and the justice is liberal (when
                            the justice is the swing vote)</li>
          <li>lib_court:  1 if the court is liberal, 0 if not</li>
          <li>NOTE: medianJJ and lib_court are all the same for a given term, while the
          other variables differ for each case, for each justice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In only the justice-centered database:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>liberal:    1 if the justice is liberal, 0 if not)</li>
          <li>median: explained above</li>
        </ul>
